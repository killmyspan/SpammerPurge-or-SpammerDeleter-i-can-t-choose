## Purpose

Recently, there has been a massive infestation of spam on YouTube where fake impersonator accounts leave spam/scam replies to hundreds of users on a creator's videos. YouTube has fortunately now made it so the "Hide User From Channel" button instantly removes all of that user's comments, but there are sometimes many different spammers, and it can be difficult to find them all.

Therefore I created this script to allow you to easily and automatically purge these spammer comments.
